I used Ubuntu as a VM for front-end development. But recently I have been testing [Windows Subsystem of Linux (WSL 2)](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/wsl-2-is-now-available-in-windows-insiders/) and so far it's good. No need to run VM anymore! (Since I only care about the command line functionality). Also, I have been trying out the [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) and I gotta say that it is amazing!

Here is a guide on [how to get started with WSL](https://dev.to/pluralsight/getting-started-with-wsl-1abp) by @jeremycmorgan.

So my terminal looks like this right now:

And here is the guide for the same. (Assuming that you have WSL enabled, Ubuntu and Windows Terminal App installed, if not, you can [follow this guide](https://dev.to/pluralsight/getting-started-with-wsl-1abp))

### Install oh-my-zsh:

Make sure zsh is installed:

```python
apt install zsh
```

Install ohmyzsh

```python

```

### Install and configure Powerline fonts

To install the Powerline fonts:

1. Open a Powershell session as administrator.
    
2. Download and expand the Powerline fonts repository:
    
    `powershell -command "& { iwr [<https://github.com/powerline/fonts/archive/master.zip>](<https://github.com/powerline/fonts/archive/master.zip>) -OutFile ~\\fonts.zip }" Expand-Archive -Path ~\\fonts.zip -DestinationPath ~`
    
3. Update the execution policy to allow the installation of the fonts:
    
    `Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass`
    
4. Run the installation script:
    
    `~\\fonts-master\\install.ps1`
    
5. Revert the execution policy back the default value:
    
    `Set-ExecutionPolicy Default`

### Choose your theme! 🎨

You can now choose the theme you want for your terminal, there are many to [choose from](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Themes). I am using "agnoster". You can do so by:

* Edit the '.zshrc' file `nano ~/.zshr`
    
* Change the theme to one that you selected:

You can also enable different Plugins:

```python
plugins=(
  git
  bundler
  dotenv
  osx
  rake
  rbenv
  ruby
)
```

Let me know which theme you picked! Also, feel free to reach out if you have any concerns.
