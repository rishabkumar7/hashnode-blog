# How to build a blog with Gatsby and AWS - Part 1

You always wanted to start blogging and now you are looking to have your own site, well this guide will set you up with a minimal looking blog.
Even though I love @[Hashnode](@hashnode)  and can't express my love for it, I will keep on using it for my personal blog, but it's still a good project and learning experience to create your own.

## Goal âš½
Have a responsive personal blog site, with markdown support.
We will be using [Gatsby JS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and host it on AWS with [Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/)
