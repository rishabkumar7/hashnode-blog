# Cloud Certification Notes Next App - Hackathon

Hello amazing people ðŸ‘‹

Hope you all are doing great.
For this blog, as the title suggests, it's my submission for the @[Hashnode](@hashnode) Hackathon!

## What I built? ðŸ› 

As some of you may know about the notes for my cloud certification that I have made publicly available for the community via GitHub.

I was not expecting so many people using it.

And 68 stars on GitHubðŸ˜²

So I decided as part of this Hackathon, let's make a Web app that will serve my cloud certification notes.

- [CloudNotes App on Vercel](https://cloudnotes.rishabkumar7.vercel.app/)
- [Source Code on GitHub](https://github.com/rishabkumar7/nextjs-tailwindcss-blog-starter)

## Choosing the Tech Stack ðŸ’»

I recently started using Next and was really loving few features about it!

Last week I made a pokedex app using NextJS and served it as a Docker container. Check it out how I did it:

So I used a Next blog starter and hosted it on Vercel. For the cover images I am hosting them in AWS S3.

## Building the App ðŸ“‘

So after looking at the blog starter, I was pleased as it used markdown for the blog posts. I already had the notes in the markdown format, so it was easy to setup.
Customizing was a bit hard, as I am new to Tailwind but have been keener to learn it.
So this would help me learn it!

The next steps would be to make it PWA - Progressive Web App, to make it more accessible across multiple devices.

## The Hackathon ðŸ‘€

So I am not sure what category the app would fall in for the Hackathon, but I wanted to do something for the community. Looking forward to the fellow hackathon participants, and cool projects they come up with.

Good Luck everyone! ðŸ’œ
