# A Git CLI cheatSheet

Hello amazing people 👋

I am finally back in 🍁and after a 20 hour flight, I needed some time to relax and get back to my EST time zone schedule.

This week I had some fun with cleaning up my [Github](https://github.com/rishabkumar7), while I was doing that I realized why not create a Git CLI cheat sheet to help other.

Now, let me get started with Git.

## What is Git?

Git is a free, open-source version control software. It was made by Linus Torvalds in 2005. This tool is a version control system that was at first evolved to work with a few engineers on the Linux Kernel.

This basically means that Git is a content tracker. So Git can be used to store content — and it is mostly used to store code because of the other features it provides.

Real life projects generally have multiple developers working in parallel. So they need a version control system like Git to ensure that there are no code clashes between them. 

The branch system in Git permits developers to work independently on an undertaking (For instance: One branch - > One errand OR One branch - > One developer). Fundamentally consider Git a little programming application that controls your code base, in case you're a developer.

So to begin utilizing Git, we need to realize where to have our repositories. 

A repository (or "Repo" for short) is a task that contains numerous documents. For our situation a repository will contain code-based records. 

There are two different ways you can have your repositories. One is on the web (on the cloud) and the second is not on web (self-hosted). 

There are three well known hosting services: GitHub, GitLab and BitBucket.

I would like to share this amazing [article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-beginners-guide-to-git-github/) 'The Beginners Guide to Git' by Thanoshan MV.

Now let's get to the the cli commands.

## Some Git CLI commands

*Git : branching*
- `git branch`

- `git branch <branch-name>`
command creates a new branch.

- `git checkout <branch-name>`
command is used to switch from one branch to another.

- `git merge <branch-name>`
command merges the specified branch’s history into the current branch.

- `git checkout -b <branch-name>`
command creates a new branch and also switches to it.


*Git : Initiating a repository*
- `git init`
command is used to start a new repository.

- `git status`
command lists all the files that have to be committed.


*Git : Pulling & pushing from and to repositories*
- `git remote add origin <link-to-repo>`
ommand is used to connect your local repository to the remote server.

- `git push -u origin main`
command sends the committed changes of main branch to your remote repository.

- `git clone <link-to-clone-repo>`
command is used to obtain a repository from an existing URL.

- `git pull`
command fetches and merges changes on the remote server to your working directory.


*Git : Staging*
- `git add <file-name>`
command adds a file to the staging area.

- `git add <file-name> <second-file-name> <third-file-name>`
command adds one or more files to the staging area.

- `git add .`
command adds all files under the current directory to the staging area.

- `git add --all`
command finds all new and updated files everywhere throughout the project and add them to the staging area.

- `git add -A`
Same as `--all`

- `git rm --cached <file-name>`


- `git reset <file-name>`
command unstages the file, but it preserves the file contents
