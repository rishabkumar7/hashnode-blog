A few years ago(2018), I was working full-time in Tech Support. The job paid the bills, but it wasn’t what I wanted to do long term.

I tried staying back after work to study AWS, but most days I was drained. After troubleshooting tickets for 8 hours, my brain was fried. So I made a small shift — I started coming in early. One hour before my shift started, I’d grab a coffee and study.

That one change made all the difference.

No one told me to do it. There was no applause. But it gave me a sense of control. I wasn’t just reacting to life anymore — I was preparing for what I wanted next.

## Why Bother?

If you already work full-time, it’s easy to justify skipping the extra effort.

“I’m tired.”  
“There’s no time.”  
“I’ll start next week.”

I told myself the same things.

But the truth is, you don’t need motivation. You need a reason. Mine was simple: I wanted to do better for my family — and my bank account was a constant reminder of that.

## Study to Excel, Not Just to Escape

When I got promoted to a Cloud Engineer role, I didn’t stop studying.

But the focus shifted. I wasn’t studying to get out — I was studying to get better. I spent time learning architecture patterns, reading about what other companies were building, and figuring out how to apply those ideas in our own environment.

This wasn’t about certifications or titles anymore. It was about doing the job well — with care and discipline.

## COVID Changed My Routine Again

When the pandemic hit, life slowed down. No commuting. No social plans. I got back into a consistent morning routine: wake up at **5 AM**, study until **7**, then start work.

That year, I sat **12 certifications**.

But more importantly, I built momentum. That led to me leading DevOps and SRE projects — and eventually transitioning fully into a DevOps role.

## The Final Push: Big Tech

At one point, I decided I wanted to break into Big Tech — Amazon, Google, Microsoft.

So I started studying 2–3 hours a day. Not because I had endless energy, but because I made a decision. I blocked out time. I protected that time.

No hacks. Just intention.

## Studying Feels Like Levelling Up

Eventually, I started enjoying the process. Studying became like levelling up a character in a video game. Every new concept I understood felt like unlocking a new skill tree.

That mindset helped me stay consistent. Even when it felt boring. Even when I didn’t see progress.

## Guard Your Focus

Lately, it’s been harder to focus. Social media — especially short-form content — makes it tough to sit still and learn.

But here’s the thing: the ability to focus is a skill now. And if you can build it, you already have an edge. While everyone else is scrolling, you’re building. I have some more thoughts on [how our moms were right about the phone!](https://blog.rishabkumar.com/how-smartphones-are-robbing-us)

## So, How Do You Study With a Full-Time Job?

Here’s what worked for me:

* **Time-block your mornings.** Even 30–60 minutes is enough if you’re consistent.
    
* **Study when your energy is highest.** For me, that was mornings. For you, it might be evenings or lunch breaks.
    
* **Have a clear goal.** Not just “learn stuff,” but “get better at X,” or “prepare for Y.”
    
* **Treat distractions like enemies.** Your phone isn’t neutral — it’s a constant test of your discipline.
    
* **Accept that it’s not supposed to be easy.** It’s supposed to be worth it.

## Final Thoughts

You don’t need a perfect setup to start. You just need to start.

I didn’t go to some fancy school. I worked nights at a gas station and delivered pizzas. I studied in the mornings before work and learned as I went.

The point isn’t to “hustle 24/7.” The point is to carve out *some* time, consistently, and use it with intention.

> — *Marcus Aurelius*

Because studying with a full-time job is hard. But so is staying in a role that doesn’t challenge you.

Choose your hard.
