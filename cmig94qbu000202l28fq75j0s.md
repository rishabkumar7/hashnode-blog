Hello amazing people!

I am thrilled to share that I recently passed the new [**Google Cloud Generative AI Leader Exam**](https://cloud.google.com/learn/certification/generative-ai-leader)! This foundational certification is a great way to validate your knowledge of GenAI concepts and Google Cloud's offerings, even if you don't have extensive technical experience.

For my preparation, I focused on the official learning paths and leveraged my existing hands-on experience. I wasn't surprised that the exam content very closely matched the objectives laid out in the study guide, which made the process very straightforward.

Here is my study guide based on the resources I used and my experience sitting for the exam.

## Exam Overview

The Generative AI Leader certification is a foundational exam designed to assess your knowledge across four key areas.

* **Format:** Multiple-choice questions (50-60 total) \[[01:08](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdRVM_I3Rf4&t=68)\]

## Skills Measured in the Exam

The [official exam guide](https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/generative_ai_leader_exam_guide_english.pdf) provides a clear breakdown of the weightage for each section. I found that the actual exam reflected these percentages very well.

## Resources I Used

I relied completely on two main educational resources and my practical experience to prepare for this certification.

**1\. Cloud Skills Boost Learning Paths**

* [**Generative AI Leader Path**](https://www.skills.google/paths/1951)**:** This path has five courses and is specifically aligned with the certification.
    
* [**Introduction to Generative AI Path**](https://www.skills.google/course_templates/536)**:** If you are new to the field, I highly recommend going through this path as well. I particularly enjoyed the modules on Responsible AI, which are crucial for understanding Google Cloud's offerings.
    

**2\. Hands-on Experience**

While this is a foundational exam, having practical experience was a huge advantage. My experience working with the Gemini API and Vertex AI and its offerings, such as implementing RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) with BigQuery, helped me understand the concepts not just theoretically but practically.

**3\. Personal Notes**

I also took extensive personal notes and created mind maps to help internalize the details. I've cleaned up and shared my personal notes publicly for anyone preparing:

## The Experience

I found the online proctoring process straightforward, though it does require you to ensure your environment is clean and free of notes. I finished the exam in about 65 minutes, well within the 90-minute limit.

You get an immediate pass/fail result, but the official confirmation and your [**Credly badge**](https://www.credly.com/badges/6162937c-5e6f-48ab-bad5-cd3cd670d832/public_url) usually take about 24 hours to arrive via email.
