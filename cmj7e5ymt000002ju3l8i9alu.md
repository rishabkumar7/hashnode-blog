Hey everyone! If you’ve been following along, you might know that I recently passed the [**Google Cloud Professional Cloud Security Engineer exam**](https://cloud.google.com/learn/certification/cloud-security-engineer/). To be honest, the whole process was a bit of a sprint, and I wanted to share my journey with you, including the challenges, resources, and strategies I used to pass the exam.

## The Journey to Certification

### Why I Took the Exam

Now, you might be wondering, "Rishab, you’re a developer advocate at Twilio, why focus on cloud security?" Well, here’s the deal. I’ve always envisioned myself working in some aspect of **cloud security** in the future. Not that I’m planning on leaving developer relations anytime soon, but when the time comes to transition to a more security-focused role, I believe this will be the smoothest route for me. Why? Because I’ve got **five years of cloud engineering and DevOps experience**, and adding security to that mix seems like the most natural progression.

This was my chance to deepen my knowledge of **Google Cloud security**, and I'm glad I took it. The **GCP Cloud Security certification** aligns with my long-term goals of gaining more specialized cloud security skills.

### The Tight Timeline

Now, here’s where it gets interesting. I only had **8 days** to prepare for the exam, which is a pretty short timeline for something as comprehensive as this. Why the rush? Well, as a [Google Developer Expert (GDE)](https://g.dev/rishabincloud), I had a certification voucher that would expire by April 1st. So, I had no choice but to prepare quickly, but I was confident that my hands-on experience would help me move through the material faster.

I started prepping on **March 22nd**, and the exam was scheduled for **March 30th**, just a week to go through the material and practice.

## Exam Overview

Before jumping into study materials, let’s talk a bit about what the exam actually covers:

The **Cloud Security Engineer** exam assesses your ability to:

* **Configure access and secure communication** within Google Cloud
    
* **Establish boundary protection** and manage data protection
    
* **Support compliance requirements** and manage operations
    

You can find all this information in the official [**exam guide**](https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/professional_cloud_security_engineer_exam_guide_english.pdf), and I highly recommend reading it before starting your prep. It provides a solid understanding of the services you’ll need to master, plus the weightage of each domain in the exam.

For this exam, Google recommends that you have **3+ years of industry experience**, with at least **one year of hands-on experience** designing and managing solutions in Google Cloud. While I didn’t have years of **cloud security experience** specifically, my background in **cloud engineering and DevOps** helped a lot. I focused on practicing **hands-on labs** and building projects with a security mindset, which worked well for me.

### Exam Details

* **Duration**: 2 hours
    
* **Questions**: 50-60 multiple-choice questions
    
* **Cost**: $200 (I used my **GDE voucher**)
    
* **Format**: Multiple-choice questions covering various topics in cloud security.

## Study Resources & Strategy

Let’s get into the nitty-gritty of the study materials I used.

### Hands-on Projects & Labs

As you know, I’m a big believer in **hands-on learning**, it’s the only way to truly retain skills. That’s why I prioritized **projects** and **labs** over just reading books or watching videos.

One of the projects I worked on was updating my **home lab**. I have a spare **Linux server** running **Docker and Kubernetes** in my home network. I set up a **secure tunnel system** using **Tailscale** to connect my server at home to my **GCP Ubuntu server**, ensuring secure communication between both. This project involved configuring **VPCs**, **firewall rules**, and **networking**, all of which were essential for the exam.

Another project was a **URL shortener** hosted on **Google Cloud** using **Cloud Run**. This project helped me practice security principles like:

* **Service accounts** for secure access between GCP resources
    
* **Cloud Armor** and **Cloud CDN** for security and performance
    
* **Cloud Logging and Monitoring** for auditing and visibility

These hands-on projects reinforced my understanding of Google Cloud’s security features and were invaluable in preparing for the exam.

### Books and Online Courses

* I used the **Google Cloud Certified Professional Cloud Security Engineer Exam Guide** by Ankush Chadri and Prashant Kulkarni (available on **O'Reilly**). I didn’t complete the entire book but referred to it for specific topics like **Data Loss Prevention (DLP)** and **Cloud Encryption**.
    
* I also used [**Google Cloud Skills Boost** **Security Engineer path**](https://www.skills.google/paths/15), which offers interactive labs and courses. This is a great resource if you want a more structured path for your learning.
    
* Additionally, I referenced courses from **Cloud Academy**, which I accessed through my **AWS Community Builder** membership. This course had **hands-on labs** and was really helpful for reinforcing key concepts.
    

### Practice Exams

I always recommend taking **practice exams** before the real deal. I used [**Whizlabs**](https://www.whizlabs.com/google-cloud-certified-professional-cloud-security-engineer/) practice exams to test myself on the specific domains. The exams on Whizlabs are domain-based, so you can focus on specific areas that need more attention. I completed almost all of them, and this helped me identify areas where I was weaker, allowing me to focus my limited study time more effectively.

## Exam Experience

When exam day came, I felt ready. The exam took me about **1 hour and 5 minutes** to complete, leaving me with time to review my answers. Google Cloud certifications don’t provide a score breakdown, but I passed, and the [**Credly badge**](https://www.credly.com/badges/34d1ecd6-b94e-4692-adda-e7f5d2c090ee/public_url) was issued the very next day!

Here are some key topics to focus on for the exam based on my experience:

### Key Focus Areas

1. **Network Security**: VPCs, subnets, firewalls, load balancing, and private Google access. Understanding how to secure networks and control traffic flow is crucial.
    
2. **Data Security**: Encryption techniques, protecting data at rest and in transit, **Customer Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK)**, and **Data Loss Prevention (DLP)**.
    
3. **Detection and Response**: Learn about **Security Command Center**, **Cloud Logging**, and **Cloud Monitoring**. These tools help with visibility and auditing your cloud resources.
    
4. **Security Best Practices**: Understand **binary authorization** (ensuring only trusted containers are deployed) and **compliance assessments**.
    

I have also made my notes publicly available for you all to review:

## Final Thoughts

Passing the **Google Cloud Professional Cloud Security Engineer exam** was a challenging but rewarding experience. The key to my success was a balanced approach that combined **hands-on projects**, **lab practice**, and focused **study resources**. Even with a tight timeline, the experience and skills I gained during the preparation process made it all worth it.

If you're preparing for this exam, I wish you the best of luck! Stay focused, dive into hands-on labs, and remember that the best way to solidify your knowledge is through practical experience.
