## A beginner cloud project - The Cloud Resume API

Want to impress potential employers and gain hands-on cloud experience at the same time? The Cloud Resume API Challenge is the perfect way to start! By building a cloud-based API for your resume, you'll showcase your cloud computing skills while creating something that has real-world value. And the best part â€“ you don't need to be a cloud guru to get started.

## Challenge Requirements:

* **NoSQL Database**: These flexible databases, like DynamoDB (AWS), Firestore (GCP), and Cosmos DB (Azure), are a great fit for storing resume data.
    
* **Serverless Functions**: This technology lets you run code without worrying about managing servers. It's the heart of your resume API!
    
* **CI/CD (GitHub Actions)**: This tool automates the process of updating your API. Every time you change your code, GitHub Actions will repackage and redeploy it for you.

## Step-by-Step Guide

**Pick Your Cloud Playground**: The Cloud Resume API Challenge supports AWS, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), or Microsoft Azure. Pick a provider that you like best!

**Design Your Data**: Think about what information your resume API will include. Start with the basics like your name, contact details, experience, and skills. You can always expand later!

**Store your Resume Data**: Use the NoSQL Database within your selected cloud provider to store your resume data in JSON.

**Time to Code**: Your core component will be a serverless function. This function is responsible for fetching your resume data from the database and crafting a response for anyone who uses your API.

**Deploy to Cloud**: Deployment is the process that makes your API accessible over the internet.

**Test Drive Your API**: Once your API is deployed, you (or anyone else!) can send a request and see your resume displayed in a structured JSON format.

## Tips for Beginners

* Start Simple: Your initial API doesn't have to be fancy. Get the core functions working, then add features over time.
    
* The Power of Community: Visit the [Cloud Resume API website](https://cloudresumeapi.dev) to see examples from others who have taken on this challenge. You're not alone!
