# My 2021 Certification goals

Hello Amazing people ðŸ‘‹

Hope everyone is doing great.
This week I had some time to think about what my certification goals are for this year and I planned them out. As some of you may know, I had this great idea of getting started with cloud certifications last year, planning and staying consistent did help me get 8 of them!

I have 6 of them planned for this year for now.

So, I will be starting with Azure AI Fundamentals (AI-900) and will follow along with the new Security certifications by Microsoft, the Microsoft Security, Compliance, and Identity Fundamentals (SC-900). I am  planning to take both of these in March, since they are fundamentals, I am hoping I will be able to make it in time.

Moving on in the Azure world, I am planning to take Microsoft Azure Administrator (AZ-104) in May. I will have almost 45-50 days to prepare for this.

AZ-104 is followed by AZ-400, which is the 'Designing and Implementing Microsoft DevOps Solutions' exam, this would also get me the DevOps Engineer Expert badge.

Now enough with the Azure certs (just kidding). Time for some AWS. The next one I have planned for is AWS DevOps Engineer Professional, which I am thinking to take in late July (probably on my Birthday).

Last but not least, I am planning to get into the Linux certifications and hence start with [Linux Essentials by LPI](https://www.lpi.org/our-certifications/linux-essentials-overview).

Oh, by the way, have you checked out my latest video on YouTube, I did some tech swag unboxing ðŸ‘‡
