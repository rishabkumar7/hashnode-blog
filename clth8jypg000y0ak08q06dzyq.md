Hey everyone! If you're prepping for the Azure AZ-204 Developer exam, you're in the right place. I recently passed, so I want to share my experience and the strategies that worked for me.

## **My Journey**

I was excited and a little nervous heading to the test center. The exam definitely challenged me, but walking out with a passing score of 737 felt amazing! I know I barely passed, as 700 is required passing score and also I barely finished in time, so managing those minutes is essential!

## **How Did I Prepare?**

The big question, right? Here's the thing: I didn't use any traditional courses. Instead, I've been building projects on Azure for a while now, and that hands-on experience was my main study method. Here's what I focused on:

* **Microsoft Learn Challenges:** During the Microsoft Build Cloud Skills Challenge, I got a free exam voucher by completing the **Microsoft Build: Cloud Development Challenge.** It covered some of the AZ-204 modules.
    
* **Microsoft Learn Modules:** Outside of the challenge, I went through all the AZ-204 modules on Microsoft Learn. See them [here.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/exams/az-204/)
    
* **Hands-On Projects:** This was the MOST important part! Over time, I've built projects on Azure that used the skills on the exam guide. Check out tools like Azure Functions, container apps, and storage accounts.

## **Important Extras**

* **The AZ-204 Exam Guide:** Find it on the [Microsoft website](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/resources/study-guides/az-204). Be super familiar with the skills you'll be tested on.
    
* **Following are the domains** you will be tested on with weightage:
    
    * Develop Azure compute solutions (25â€“30%)
        
    * Develop for Azure storage (15â€“20%)
        
    * Implement Azure security (20â€“25%)
        
    * Monitor, troubleshoot, and optimize Azure solutions (15â€“20%)
        
    * Connect to and consume Azure services and third-party services (15â€“20%)
        
* **Open Book Option:** Azure now lets you use Microsoft Learn during the exam! I found this useful, but be careful not to spend too much time searching for every answer.
    

## **My Advice?**

* **Build, build, build!** Nothing replaces hands-on experience.
    
* **Know the exam guide** so you're building the right kinds of projects.
    
* **Manage your time** during the exam.
    

## **Not Just About the Badge**

I'm proud to now be seven-times Azure certified, but it's the knowledge that matters most. I love challenging myself to learn through real-world problem-solving!

It's totally possible to pass the AZ-204 if you're focused on practical learning. If you have the time to invest in building projects, I believe you can do it!
