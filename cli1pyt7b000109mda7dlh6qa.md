Hey there, I know, another certification blog post!

Today, I'll be sharing the resources and strategies that helped me pass the Google Cloud Associate Cloud Engineer exam. Whether you're new to the world of cloud and cloud certifications or have some experience, I hope you'll find these tips useful. I also have a video about the same and posts about other cloud certifications, so make sure to check those out too.

## My Background and Motivation

Before I dive into the specifics, let me give you some context. I joined Google early in January 2022 and as part of my onboarding process within the Google Cloud team, I was required to get this certification within a certain timeframe.

Having worked in cloud computing for about two and a half years, with prior experience in AWS and Azure, I was not entirely new to cloud computing concepts. However, I did need to transfer my knowledge and experience over to the Google Cloud Platform.

I dedicated around 25-30 days to preparing for the exam and was able to pass it successfully. In this post, I'll share some of the resources that helped me along the way.

## Resources That Helped Me

### Official Google Resources

To start, I referred to the Associate Cloud Engineering Exam Guide, the official exam guide by Google. It helped me understand the different sections I needed to focus on, such as setting up a cloud solution environment, planning and configuring a cloud solution, deploying and implementing a cloud solution, ensuring the successful operation of a cloud solution, and configuring access and security.

Another official resource from Google is the [Cloud Engineer Learning Path](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/paths/11). This links to the Cloud Skills Boost Lab (formerly QwickLabs) which offers six courses and 25 hands-on labs. I highly recommend going through this learning path, as it offers invaluable hands-on experience.

### Video-based Courses

For video-based courses, I opted for Coursera's "[Preparing for Your Associate Cloud Engineer Journey](https://www.coursera.org/learn/preparing-cloud-associate-cloud-engineer-exam)" and their essential courses on cloud fundamentals and infrastructure scaling and automation. Note that these courses might be paid, but Google occasionally offers challenges that allow you to access some of these resources for free.

Alternatively, freeCodeCamp and Anthony have provided a comprehensive Google Associate Cloud Engineering course on YouTube, which is completely free.

### Practice Exams

I highly recommend doing practice exams to familiarize yourself with the exam format and the type of questions you might encounter. I found Tutorial Dojo's practice exams to be particularly useful and reliable.

### Text-based Resources and Flashcards

For those who prefer text-based resources or books, I recommend the "[Google Cloud Certified Associate Cloud Engineer Study Guide" by Dan.](https://amzn.to/45qbnah)

I also used [Quizlet flashcards](https://quizlet.com/328524759/google-cloud-certified-associate-cloud-engineer-flash-cards/) to help memorize and recall key concepts. Flashcards are an excellent study tool, and the Quizlet set by "christopher\_gang" that I used included 213 flashcards covering various services relevant to the exam.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, these were the resources that I relied on for my preparation. The entire process took me around 25 days. Remember, each person's journey is unique, and what worked for me might not work for you. However, I hope that sharing my experience will provide you with some guidance and inspiration as you prepare for your Google Cloud Associate Cloud Engineer exam.

Good luck with your exam and your journey in cloud and DevOps! Feel free to reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rishabk7) or [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/rishabkumar7).
