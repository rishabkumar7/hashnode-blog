# Adding custom domain and SSL certificate Azure Static Web Apps

Hello amazing people ðŸ‘‹

So we finally had our website running the last article. Oh not sure what I am talking about, check out the first part of the blog here ðŸ‘‡

Now let's setup a custom domain and make sure we have the SSL certificate for it.

## Setting up the custom domain

Let's navigate to the Static Web App that we created in the last article.

And in the blade, you should see `Custom Domains` section. Let's click that

Now, if we click on the `Add`, it will open a tab on the right side for you to add the custom domain name, for this demo I will be using `faced.rishab.cloud`.

At this point, we have to update our Domain Name provider, in my case it's [AWS-Route53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/). So I will create a CNAME record in Route53 to point to that value provided in Azure Static Web App

If you use a different domain provider, the UI for adding the CNAME record should still look pretty similar.

Now, if we click on `Validate` after adding the CNAME record, it should succeed.

And after the validation has succeeded, click on add.

After few minutes of wait, you will see the domain is added:

Did you notice something ðŸ¤”?

Yes, it also got a SSL certificate for the site, Azure Static Web Apps provisioned a certificate.
