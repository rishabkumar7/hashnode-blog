# Dev Retro 2022 - The year I changed 2 jobs and left my dream company

## New Beginnings

Start of 2022 I finally left the company I had been working for since I started my tech career as Tech Support. It was hard to say farewell to the company where I had amazing teammates, peers and mentors who supported me throughout my journey from Tech Support to Cloud Engineer to DevOps Engineer.

I started working at Google as Technical Solutions Specialist in Jan 2022, and it was a dream for me to work for Google.

It was a hard decision for me to end my time at Google after 4 months, but it was better for my mental health! More on why I left Google:

After quitting Google, I was on a job search and was looking forward to entering the DevRel space. And after a few interviews at different companies, I joined Twilio as a Staff Developer Evangelist.

Check out my intro blog post on Twilio's blog.

## Working in DevRel

Now that my new job started, working in DevRel had its own challenges.

The first one was speaking at large events, which I hadn't done until now. My first event was Collision in Toronto after 4 weeks of joining Twilio, where I presented about Twilio's SMS API in Python.

In total, I spoke at 5 different in-person events in the following cities:

* Toronto, ON
    
* Boston, MA
    
* Manhattan, NY
    
* Rock Hill, NY

Attending AWS re:Invent was on my list since 2018 and Twilio made it possible for me. I was able to attend the conference this year in vegas. Met so many amazing community members.

## Learning and Teaching

This year I spent more time teaching than learning, which is the first time it has happened. Professionally mentored at 3 hackathons, provided 1-1 mentorship to various students and professionals as time permitted and also I think the biggest milestone for me this year was, teaching Cloud Computing at the college that I graduated from 4 years ago!

Apart from this, also contributed to Learn to Cloud, which is a free open-source guide to help you get into the cloud. Talking about *learn to cloud*, I also did a cloud podcast with my friend Gwyn for Learn to Cloud.

## Community

As you can already tell this year I produced a good amount of content for the cloud and DevOps community. In total, I published 52 YouTube videos, 12 podcast episodes and 7 technical articles.

Hoping to keep this momentum and provide more value to the community!

All this hard work did pay off as some amazing people nominated me for the [Canada Developer 30 under 30 award.](https://betakit.com/canadas-2022-developer-30-under-30/)

## 2023

I am looking forward to building some amazing connections in the community in 2023 and keep contributing.
