# How to add a logo or GIF to Windows Terminal App

Hello amazing people ðŸ‘‹

Hope you all are doing great. I am here with my first blog post of 2021 and it started with an astounding recommendation that I made to one of the fellow clouders [@jonnychipz](https://twitter.com/jonnychipz). I remember I added that Azure Functions GIF to my Terminal immediately as [Marc](https://twitter.com/marcduiker) was demonstrating it on one of the live streams.

So I thought, why not compose an article to show how to do it! I will begin with what Windows Terminal App is.

## Windows Terminal App:

So what is Windows Terminal App, in Microsoft's own words " Windows Terminal is a new, modern, fast, efficient, powerful, and productive terminal application for users of command-line tools and shells like Command Prompt, PowerShell, and WSL."
Here are some key features:
- Multiple tabs
- Beautiful text
- Settings and configurability
- Last but not the least, it's open source ðŸ’œ

Feel free to check it out on GitHub:

## Customization:

Let's dive into customizing the black & white terminal and bring some personal touch to it.

Now to add a logo or a gif to your terminal, navigate to the Settings:

The settings should open up as a JSON file:

Now to add a logo or GIF, add the `backgroundImage` to your 'defaults' property, this way it will appear on all of the terminals (CMD, PowerShell, WSL etc.)
``` "backgroundImage":"https://rishabincloud.s3.amazonaws.com/nobg.png" ```

But hey, this doesn't look neat, it just appears as a background! So now we will add few more properties for the backgroundImage:

```
"backgroundImageAlignment" : "bottomRight",
"backgroundImageOpacity":1,
"backgroundImageStretchMode": "none"
```
So here is how your settings file should look like:

And now if we look at the terminal:

Looks pretty eh!

## Bonus:
Here is the link so you can add the Azure Functions Mascot to your terminal:

`backgroundImage":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcduiker/azure-functions-university/main/img/zappy-university-192.gif`


Thanks to [Marc](https://twitter.com/marcduiker).


Also, you can customize the color scheme, I have been using [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) for a while now, here is the Ubuntu theme that I am using with it ðŸ˜‰

```{
            // Color Scheme: UbuntuLegit
            "background":  "#2C001E",
            "black":  "#4E9A06",
            "blue":  "#3465A4",
            "brightBlack":  "#555753",
            "brightBlue":  "#729FCF",
            "brightCyan":  "#34E2E2",
            "brightGreen":  "#8AE234",
            "brightPurple":  "#AD7FA8",
            "brightRed":  "#EF2929",
            "brightWhite":  "#EEEEEE",
            "brightYellow":  "#FCE94F",
            "cyan":  "#06989A",
            "foreground":  "#EEEEEE",
            "green":  "#300A24",
            "name":  "UbuntuLegit",
            "purple":  "#75507B",
            "red":  "#CC0000",
            "white":  "#D3D7CF",
            "yellow":  "#C4A000"
     }
```
