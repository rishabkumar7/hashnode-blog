## Exam Objective

Here is the official [Exam Objective for Linux Essentials](https://www.lpi.org/our-certifications/exam-010-objectives):

1. The Linux Community and a Career in Open Source
    
2. Finding Your Way on a Linux System
    
3. The Power of the Command Line
    
4. The Linux Operating System

## Preparation and Background

I had been aiming to take the Linux Essentials certification exam since 2021. Although I prepared for the exam in 2022, I didn't sit for it until 2023. Having completed college courses on Linux fundamentals and advanced networking with Linux, I was already well-versed in Linux and the command line. Additionally, I had over three years of practical experience working with Linux daily, managing approximately 50 Linux servers in a cloud environment.

## Resources Used

1. Jason Dion's Linux Essentials Course: I highly recommend this course, [available on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/linux-essentials-010/) and included in the LinkedIn Learning subscription. For North American users, LinkedIn Learning can be accessed for free through public library memberships.
    
2. TryHackMe and Linux Journey: These platforms provide hands-on practice and a gamified learning experience. [TryHackMe](http://tryhackme.com) offers Linux fundamentals rooms, while [Linux Journey](https://linuxjourney.com/) provides an introduction to the command line and important Linux concepts.
    
3. Practice Exams: Day, a recommended creator, suggests [Jason Dion's practice exams](https://www.udemy.com/course/linux-essentials-practice-exams/) for additional preparation. Although I personally didn't go through any practice exams, they can be beneficial for beginners to assess their knowledge before the actual exam.
    

## Exam Experience

I chose to take the exam at a nearby test center instead of at home. Having moved to an apartment close to a Pearson VUE test center, I found it more convenient. The exam consisted of **40 questions**, and I had **60 minutes** to complete it. However, I finished the exam in around 25 minutes. The passing score for this exam is **500 out of 800**, and I scored 650. The exam fee was **USD 120**.

## Conclusion

Obtaining the LPI Linux Essentials certification has been a valuable achievement. Linux is an essential tool in various fields, particularly in cloud and cybersecurity. Whether you're starting your career journey or looking to enhance your skill set, this certification can provide a solid foundation. In the future, I may explore additional Linux certifications. Stay tuned for more blogs and videos on useful Linux commands, the file system, and other relevant topics. Thank you for reading, and I hope you found this post helpful.
